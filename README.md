# Java_Pazaak
A Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic card game made in Java.<br>

How to play:<br>
Similar to the turn based minigame called Pazaak from the video game Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic.<br>
Each player has 4 cards in hand, and 9 slots on the table. During a player's turn, a random card is being dealt. If the score which is the sum of all cards on the player's table exceed 20 at the end of the turn, the player looses.<br>
The player has 3 actions: Stand, End Turn, Place Card.<br>
-Ending a turn will result the opponent's turn to start.<br>
-Standing is similar to ending a turn, except the player never gets another turn. Because Standing prevents another turn to happen, the score can be saved for the rest of the match, however the opponent will now be more likely to take risks to beat the standee's score.<br>
-Placing a card will change the score. There are positive, negative, dual and special cards. Dual cards can be either positive or negative, depending on what the player wants them to be (click on the + or - icon below the card)<br>

Winning match conditions: have more cards than the opponent, while lower than 21 OR the opponent's sum exeeds 20.<br>
Winning game condition: win 3 matches.<br>
